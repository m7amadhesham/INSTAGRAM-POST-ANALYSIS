# Instagram Data Analysis Project
## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to quantify the performance and conversion efficiency of individual Instagram posts and determine the causal relationship between content attributes (what we post) and distribution effectiveness (how people discover it) on key engagement and growth metrics.
## Data Scope and Key Metrics
The analysis is centered on a comprehensive dataset of individual posts, examining two core metric categories:
### A. Engagement & Interaction Metrics
Impressions: Total number of times a post was seen (Measure of visibility).

Likes, Comments, Shares: Core audience interaction metrics (Measure of resonance and virality).

Saves (Implicit in the data structure): Often included with Likes/Comments/Shares as a key indicator of content value.
### B. Conversion & Growth Metrics
Profile Visits: Measures the post's effectiveness in driving users to the account page (Measure of curiosity/interest).

Follows: The ultimate conversion metric, tracking the number of new followers gained directly from a post (Measure of growth and content attraction).
### C. Qualitative & Distribution Data
Source of Impressions: Detailed breakdown by Home (Follower loyalty), Hashtags (Discovery/New Audience), Explore (Algorithmic Virality), and Other (External traffic, profile visits, etc.).

Content of Posts: Qualitative data on the post itself (e.g., image/video/carousel, topic, style, tone) to enable correlation with performance.
